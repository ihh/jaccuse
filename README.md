# J'accuse!

Well if you challenge me
<br>
I’ll see that you lose
<br>
And if you try to cheat
<br>
I’ll get you back too
<br>
And if you tell lies
<br>
You’ll get a surprise
<br>
I’ll look you in the eyes
<br>
And point at the truth
<br>
_J’accuse!_

I’ll watch your every move
<br>
I’m cracking the clues
<br>
And if I disapprove
<br>
I’m coming at you
<br>
I’ll build up a case
<br>
To make your disgrace
<br>
I’ll stare you in the face
<br>
And guess what I’ll do
<br>
_J’accuse!_

Try to clear your name
<br>
Try to shift the blame
<br>
Try to point to me instead
<br>
Try to get ahead
<br>
There’s no doubt
<br>
I’ll call you out
<br>
Soon
<br>
As I choose
<br>
_J’accuse!_

So if you’re twisting round
<br>
And wriggling loose
<br>
I won’t be backing down
<br>
I flatly refuse
<br>
Cos I’m in the right
<br>
I’m shining a light
<br>
I’ve got you in my sight
<br>
I’m pointing at you
<br>
_J’accuse!_
